# Time Series Project: Bank of Mexico Economic Indicators

In this project we are exploring various time series models for economic data from the Bank of Mexico.

### Notes
- To get monthly data aggreated up to quarterly, in R we can use `aggregate(series, nfrequncy=4)` and it will take the mean of the three months in that quarter.
